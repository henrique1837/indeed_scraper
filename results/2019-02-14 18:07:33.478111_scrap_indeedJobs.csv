This requires you to not only be knowledgeable in all aspects of your job, but also be thoroughly abreast of market needs, competitive offerings and industry trends. Synthesizinginformation from various sources requires you to be an expert in critical thinking.Product Managers represent the voice of the customer. This requires PMs to possess deep empathy to understand customer motivations, pain-points and operating environments.

Blockchain is the core of the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. This “new” financial revolution is changing how any financial instrument like securities, derivatives, etc. are traded and settled in Wall Street and around the world. Blockchain’s mathematical verification of underlying data simplifies audit and regulatory compliance and reduces billions of dollars spent in these functions. Financial institutions are looking to leverage big data solutions as systems of record for risk analysis and decision-making more now than ever before. Come, join this revolution!What to expect as a PeerNova Product ManagerJoin our fast-paced energetic Product Management team as we build the next generation enterprise blockchain platform. Product Managers at PeerNova are not just Managers, they are Product Owners. You are not just a cog in the wheel as you would be in a larger company. Here at PeerNova, you are entrusted with complete and independent ownership of one or more capabilities - capabilities like Analytics, Workbench, Lineage, Smart Contract framework, DLT network governance, etc. Your responsibilities encompass the entire gamut of product management activities ranging from customer research and roadmap planning through iteratively building out full-fledged features and capabilities to delivering them to our customers. You will be extremely busy, but at the end of every day you will have a sense of accomplishment. Every day will be different. You may be driving feature prioritization meetings, working on a value prop deck the CEO asked you to put together, create user stories for an upcoming release, perform acceptance testing for the current release, review UX prototypes with a UX designer, create marketing collateral, all on the same day.

The company has a flat organizational structure and you will interact daily with the CEO and and the Executive team.

Decision-making is fast, without any of the bureaucratic overhead that larger companies face.Required Traits for a PeerNova Product ManagerGiven the high degree of responsibilities that you will be entrusted with alongwith the broad scope of activities you will be managing, certain traits are critical success factors for a PeerNova Product Manager. Some of the key ones are below:Product ownership implies that you are the “go to” person for your area and is recognized as such by everybody - the CEO, your peers in the Product and Engineering teams, sales teams, and customers. This requires you to not only be knowledgeable in all aspects of your job, but also be thoroughly abreast of market needs, competitive offerings and industry trends. Synthesizing information from various sources requires you to be an expert in critical thinking.Product Managers represent the voice of the customer. This requires PMs to possess deep empathy to understand customer motivations, pain-points and operating environments. PMs also require empathy to understand constraints that Engineering teams may have and be able to balance the interests of multiple stakeholders. Empathy is a critical trait for PMs.At PeerNova, you will not be micromanaged. This means you are expected to be a self-starter at every task, big or small, that you are entrusted with, without waiting for your manager to tell you what the next steps are. You should be able to get started with minimal guidance and use your ingenuity and critical thinking skills to chart a way forward at each step. You need to have a bias for action and not only be comfortable, but thrive in an environment where decisions have to be made with limited or ambiguous information.You are expected to possess excellent interpersonal and communication skills to effectively converse with customers as well as Engineering teams, Sales, peer PMs and the Executive team to set and manage expectations, discuss dependencies and tradeoffs, communicate customer needs, position your product features, etc.You are expected to roll up your sleeves and be hands-on in all aspects of your job. Creating wireframes, testing, installing local builds are all tasks that our PMs excel at.You should be fully comfortable at working simultaneously on multiple high-priority tasks, and at a fast pace. At the same time, you need to be able to adapt to any change in direction that can happen due to any number of factors like new customer requests, strategic repositioning, technological shifts, etc.You should be an expert in driving towards MVPs (Minimum Viable Product) for each of the features/capabilities you own. All activities you plan should be geared towards the end goal of shipping product, of the highest quality, as quickly as possible.The specific roleThe Product Manager - Smart Contracts and DApps will own and manage the roadmap for the Smart Contracts Framework capability. Our Smart Contracts Framework provides the tools and technology foundation for customers to define, test and deploy smart contracts on the Cuneiform platform. Cuneiform smart contracts are written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL) which can be compiled to Ethereum bytecode and executed by an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Cuneiform smart contract definitions include not only business logic, but associated state changes and protocols - who can participate in a transaction, what conditions constitute transaction finality, what consensus model is applicable, the set of states associated with specific transactions, etc. You will be responsible for designing value-added smart contract features: create tools that enable business users to create financial assets in Cuneiform, define financial transactions involving assets on the blockchain, specify states and state transitions, define consensus policies, etc. via a self-serve templatized, intuitive user interface. How will users write distributed applications (DApps) and invoke smart contract functions? How will the smart contracts and DApps be deployed to the network? What are the critical non-functional factors to consider: Identity management, security, scalability, maintainability, reliability? What do we optimize for in our Smart Contract framework? What client libraries are users required to install? What sample applications do we need to build to help drive adoption?

","Reserve is a blockchain-based project that is developing a cryptocurrency that is supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, called a stablecoin. It will be inexpensive to send and provide users access to the benefits of cryptocurrencies without the volatility. While we expect that Reserve will be valuable to traders and app developers inside the crypto ecosystem, we’re most excited about it replacing inflationary currencies and dysfunctional banks. And with the currencies in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey, and elsewhere approaching hyperinflation, now seems like the right moment for people to choose something new.

 

 Decentralized currencies have the opportunity to change global financial and monetary institutions for the better. If you’re excited by this idea, we would love to hear from you.

This role therefore requires substantial methodological flexibility. You will support the engineering team with its mission to efficiently ship smart contracts that are correct and secure, and adapt along the way to improved processes.

We objectively define each product in terms of the market it serves and the technology it leverages.We uncover market-gaps or user pain-points by identifying CIV (Challenging, Important or Valuable) problems specific to that domain. We employ a standardized process to elicit relevant information from SMEs and succinctly describe each CIV Problem.We then define Core Functionality (CFs) which the product will implement in order to address each CIV Problem. Through a combination of CIV Problems and CFs, we are in a position to analyze the product-market fit in an objective, standardized fashion. A CIV problem without any CFs is a remaining gap, while a CF which doesn’t address a CIV problem represents unnecessary complexity within the solution.Once we have articulated the product-market fit, we turn our attention (and most of our time) towards identifying the Important Technical Decisions (ITDs) that will provide the core functionality in the most effective way.As a VP, you will: Define CIV problems, CFs and make ITDs as part of a weekly iteration of a product specification. Control the scope of these specifications and simplify them by focusing on the core of the product and the real world problem that it solves. Identify technology trends and understand when to apply them - leveraging leading open source and SaaS solutions to reduce the size and complexity of the product codebaseHelp to evolve our standardized processes and playbooks and to ensure that each VP deliverable meets our high quality standards.As part of a collaborative group of technical experts, you will create and iterate our process and technology playbooks, providing clear and concise guidance on how to produce each type of deliverable or when and how to apply a particular technology.On a daily basis you will leverage your existing technical expertise and communication skills to: Know what’s important. Understand where to focus your attention. Look for factors that impact the core of the product.Communicate clearly and effectively. Not only should you be able to make your point concisely and unambiguously, but you also need to distill the important information from what others say and write.Be able to simplify. Focus on the core the product, where your input can have the greatest impact.ONLINE HIRING EVENTA hiring event is a scheduled online event where all our relevant testing relating to a role is conducted on the same day.

They focus on data structures & algorithms, not slick UI/UX. They write their logic/rationale down so that it can be vetted by healthy debate - or at least understood! They engage directly on the important topics. They spec important product simplifications (""non-features"") as often as they spec the “must-have features”.How would you describe a day of work as a VP of TPM at Crossover?If I had to describe it succinctly, I would say that the main thing a VP of TPM does each day is to focus on a ""thing"" that needs a solution. It may be a data structure or an algorithm for a brand new product. It may be how to change an existing codebase to adopt some new technology component that will make the product much better, or retire a bunch of low-value code, or a variety of other problems we are trying to solve. TPMs write down their thinking/logic in the most succinct and clear way possible. They work with other people (global/remote) to ask questions in order to get peer-feedback, and feedback from their manager.How many products does each role manage? What’s the typical size of each product team?We don't limit the number of products that TPMs work on in that way. They generally work on one product at a time, and once finished solving that problem/design, they move onto another product. They may come back to a product too. We want TPMs to have continuous learning. By doing this, our TPMs learn many new technologies, design patterns and architectures, industries, and business models. We have designed our organization and processes so that this works. We like people on the team to contribute work and ideas in a fluid manner, in the same way, that great, high-caliber engineering teams all work on many different parts of the same codebase. As long as they are all of sufficient skill, collaborative, and have the right review/approval process, so the code isn't a complete mess. It may be slower in the short-term (because of ramp up) but its better in the long-term. Our engineering teams generally follow the ""2 Pizza Rule"" regarding size.How are the teams formed within the actual projects and as VP of TPM would I have any influence over the selection of the project I'd be working on?Our view is that TPMs (and the TPM Org) should not focus on managing or influencing the engineering delivery team. We leave that to engineering management. Our TPMs focus on making the important technical decisions that in aggregate define “how the software should work to deliver customer value” and not on “how the engineering team should work to deliver the software.” An analogy would be the way an Architect's job is to clearly define the important decisions regarding the construction of a building but is not part of the building team that the construction company uses to build the building.How do you know what insights are important?The important decisions are always there, and they always get made one way or another. The question is whether they are made deliberately and with the gravity they require, or whether you find out how they were made after it is too late. Our process works to identify these decisions early - we invest the necessary time and skill, drive alignment and feedback from all parties, and learn and improve over time. To do this, TPMs must be very technical and able to explain the reasoning for their engineering decisions. TPMs need to see the ""big picture"" and focus on the important capabilities, not the many minor features. TPMs must be fast learners and great writers and know the difference between controlling what is truly ""important"" versus micro-managing engineering (which we do not want to do). This is the core of our 30-day CTO Bootcamp process - we, focus on our quality bar, and the goal of our processes.How do you measure success?This is a long answer, but the basic idea is that we define actual deliverables for TPMs. These weekly deliverables are quite structured, and we check the quality of the content within those specs. For example, we evaluate how ""Important"" the content is, how correct the ""Technical"" content is, and how clear and justified the rationale for the ""Decision"" is. We call those ITDs, and TPMs get feedback on the quality of their work. So, by measuring the Quality and the Quantity of work, we measure success. In the longer term, we also measure how well those decisions played out in the real worldHow does the TPM organization fit within the rest of the organization?Our approach to Product Management is heavily technical, and that is because of our belief that the most important thing is mapping the customer problems to a 10x better engineering solution to that problem.
